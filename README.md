# Weather-Forecast-Web-App

## Description

This project creates a weather forecast application. Built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, the program relies on fetch calls to the OpenWeather One Call API. When the user enters the name of a city, the first api call returns a longitude and latitude value. Then, a second api call is used from these values to obtain the actual weather forecast, which is then printed on the screen as a current value, along with a five-day forecast.

## Installation

May be used live at . Otherwise, you may download from the [Github repo]() and run index.html in a web browser.

## Usage

Type the name of a city in the search field, then press enter or click search. After this, current weather information and a five-day forecast will be displayed on screen. Your last ten searches will be saved in the sidebar and can be clicked on to view that weather information again.
